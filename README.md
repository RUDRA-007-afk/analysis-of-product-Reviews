# 📊 Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Sentiment Analysis** tool using Python to classify product reviews as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with libraries like **TextBlob** or **NLTK (VADER)** to analyze the sentiment of each review. The final output includes both classification results and visualizations to understand sentiment distribution.

  - A **simulated dataset** (CSV file with a column like `review_text`)
  - Publicly available datasets from **Kaggle** or **UCI**
